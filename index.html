    <!-- MAIN SECTION: What is ModernWeb and what it does -->
    <section>
      <h1>Why ModernWeb?</h1>
      <p>Web developers have a problem nowadays on the web. There's too many web browsers and there's too many versions
      of these browsers, some of them from more than a decade ago. ModernWeb purpose is to change that by
      helping people update their browsers and start seeing a new web. A web that loads faster and it's much
      more beautiful than before.</p>
      <p>Many things have changed since the web came to public. Today we have HTML5, CSS3 and newer versions of JavaScript
      that helps developers create a deeper user experience. Legacy browsers doesn't support these kind of technology as
      you can see on <a href="http://caniuse.com">http://caniuse.com</a></p>
      <p>As many web developers know, we have workarounds for those legacy browsers: polyfills and fallbacks. The problem is
      that the many browsers you want to support the many crap you put in your code, things like checking for features and applying then
      according to browsers capabilities.</p>
      <p>So we decided to create this banner. By using it, developers can unleash their creativity and actually show people how great
      it would be if everyone use a modern browser. In fact, this very own website use this approach, if you are seeing this on
      a legacy browser you should already be seeing the ModernWeb banner. Update to a newer browser and you should see this page render
      a little bit better and the banner won't appear.</p>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section>
      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>ModernWeb works by checking canvas support on the browser. We chose this feature because it helps divide modern browsers from
      legacy ones. If you need more accurate feature checking we suggest you to use <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> with ModernWeb.displayBanner()
      method.</p>
      <p>If the browser doesn't support canvas we show the banner with the option to download the most popular modern browsers.

    <!-- SUGGESTED BROWSERS -->
    <section>
      <h1>Suggested browsers</h1>
      <article>
        <h1 id="chrome">Google Chrome</h1>
        <p>Google Chrome is an excellent browser made by Google that uses the WebKit engine (future versions will use the WebKit based Blink engine). It is always updated to be compatible with
        the latest resources regarding HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It has a nice user interface that is simple to use and an automatic
        update system that keeps your browser always updated without bothering you.
        </p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 id="firefox">Mozilla Firefox</h1>
        <p>Mozilla Firefox is a browser from Mozilla (a non-profit organization that pushes the web forward) that uses the Gecko engine.
        Firefox is designed to be simple and easy to use, yet pretty customizable. It is important that you keep it always up to date,
        fortunately Mozilla has implemented an automatic update system in the latest versions of the browser.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 id="safari">Apple Safari</h1>
        <p>Safari is the first browser that used the WebKit engine, which was originally developed by Apple. This browser is a nice
        option too, as it supports most of the modern features available.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 id="opera">Opera</h1>
        <p>Opera, from Opera Software used to use the Presto engine to render websites, but they decided to switch to WebKit seeking
        to be compatible with websites developed for WebKit. This browser can be used as reference to developers as it implements
        new resources very fast.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <h1 id="ie">Internet Explorer</h1>
        <p>This browser used to be a problem to developers worldwide, but since IE10 this has changed. The latest versions of Internet
